# PFD-BLOG

Week 1

Team Progress:
This week our group met up and discussed about the ideas we had come up with over brainstorming and researching the past week and which ones we would use for this project. We also finalised our roles for the project. 

We had decided that based on the Challenge Statement given to us, we would focus on those with learning disabilities and autism. We had also decided that I would be one of the developers for the group, and handling the Front End with my teammate LiWei while our other teammates Nathan, YeowTeik and Junhui would be handling the back end of the website.

During the discussions and meetings we were able to come to a decision that we would be focusing on those with learning disabilities and autism for this project

Individual Reflection:

Personally, I feel that as the developer of the group i have a responsibility to work on and make sure I make our project up to the standards which everyone will be satisfied with and push myself to do better.





Week 2

Team Progress:

This week my group took the feedback that we got from the OCBC Coach and managed to finalise our idea. We decided that  we would have a special account for the person with autism with all the functions of a normal banking customer but with a simplified User Interface (UI). In the helper account they would be alerted to any big transactions made by the special account linked to it and the helper would have to verify and allow for the transaction to go through. The helper account would be another type of account where they can only approve or disapprove the large transactions. The helper account would have limited functions and would not be able to control the user's account, this is to ensure that the user would be able to have their own freedom and independence. When the user with autism signs up for an account with OCBC, they must submit a image of their doctors letter/medical certificate to verify their condition.

Individual Reflection/ OAL materials reflection:

This week i have looked through the OAL material of design thinking and it helped me to be able to come up with ideas with my group. With this new knowledge I was able to ideate with my teammates effectively and managed to come up with an idea that we thought addressed the problem statement and was satisfactory. 





Week 3

Team Progress: 
This week my group started the basic development of our functions and outlook. We also worked on completely finishing the wireframe of our entire product. As a result, we managed to start on our AI voice recognition system, setup our SCRUM dashboard with the different sprints. We brainstormed finalised ideas too. One idea we discussed involves integrating an AI chatbox tailored for users with autism. This chatbot enables users to sign up for a bank account using voice recognition, mimicking the experience of an in-person bank visit. This is to reduce physical bank visits for new account openings and encourage users to open accounts online. This innovative approach aims to streamline the process and boost online account openings.

Individual Reflection:
This week while discussing with the group to finalise our idea and also starting basic parts of our functions. I have helped out with adding the data into our data base which is needed for our login details. I also managed to help out by starting the fake data for yeow teik to use to train the AI model. All in all the pase is starting to ramp up for the assignment as we push towards completing our goals.
